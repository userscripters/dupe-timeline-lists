    --about "The native post timeline displays \"duplicate lists edited\" event as a barely readable blob of links with excessive verbosity (\"duplicate list changed from [list of links] to [list of links]\"). This userscript diffs the changes and displays them as easy to visually parse lists of items.

As of v1.2.0, also fixes duplicate list edit entries on /revisions pages.

As of v3.0.0 uses its own storage for optional configuration (available by installing a [Userscript Configurer][1] peer dependency)
