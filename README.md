| Description | Userscript for properly displaying duplicate lists in post timelines |
| License | [GPL-3.0-or-later](https://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-3.0-or-later) |
| Version | 2.0.1 |

The native post timeline displays "duplicate lists edited" event as a barely readable blob of links with excessive verbosity ("duplicate list changed from [list of links] to [list of links]"). This userscript diffs the changes and displays them as easy to visually parse lists of items.

As of v1.2.0, also fixes duplicate list edit entries on /revisions pages.
